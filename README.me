# Project Explanation
# Motivation
Unforeseen rains often cause us to forget to bring down clothes after drying. This leads to re-washing, consuming extra water and energy. The Automated Cloth Descender ensures your home is prepared for unexpected rain by quickly bringing down clothes before they get wet.

# Objective
To design a device that automatically brings down clothes from a drying rod and places them safely into a basket, either when it rains or on demand, using a remote.

# Key Components
1. Humidity Sensor: Detects high humidity/rain and sends a signal to the servo motor.
2. Servo Motor: Rotates the rod at a certain angle (60°) to allow clothes to slide into the basket.
3. IR Module & Remote: Enables manual control to bring down clothes anytime, even when it’s not raining.

# Design & Implementation
Two sticks are arranged perpendicularly; clothes are hung on one end connected to the servo motor.
When the humidity sensor detects rain, the servo rotates, bending the rod and allowing clothes to slide into an open basket.
The basket lid automatically closes after 70 seconds, ensuring all clothes are collected.
The IR module allows manual control via a remote to activate the mechanism at any time.

# Workflow
Automatic Mode: Humidity sensor detects rain → Servo bends rod → Clothes slide into basket → Basket lid closes after 70s.
Manual Mode: User triggers IR remote → Servo bends rod → Clothes slide into basket → Basket lid closes.

# Result
The device successfully brings down clothes automatically before rain, saving time, water, and energy. Manual control ensures flexibility even on non-rainy days.

# Conclusion
The Automated Cloth Descender is a simple, efficient, and practical solution for protecting clothes from unexpected rain, improving convenience and water conservation at home.
